## Supported Emoji

See [Support.md](Support.md).

## Data

The contained emoji are the faces and cats defined by [Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/1.0/full-emoji-list.html). The polarity was hand classified (by one person) based on the names of these emoji (sometimes synonyms) and their [AFINN-111](https://github.com/wooorm/afinn-111) values. Special care was given to **not** classify based on the images (as different vendors use different pictograms), but only on words and how they are used.

Note that some emoji receive arguably confusing polarities, such as `stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes` (`0`), due to being used for both positive and negative emotions.
